Student management system web based application.
My first project
📘 Overview: Student Management System
The Student Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of student information within educational institutions. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java (JSP/Servlets), and MySQL, the system provides administrators with an intuitive interface to perform essential operations on student records.

🔑 Key Features
CRUD Operations: Add, update, view, and delete student details such as name, roll number, course, and contact information.

Secure Data Handling: Student records are stored in a MySQL database, ensuring reliability and security.

Backend Integration: Powered by Java Servlets and JSP, enabling dynamic content rendering and robust server-side processing.

Form Validation: Ensures accuracy and consistency of data entry through client-side and server-side validation.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project serves as a practical introduction to full-stack development, helping learners understand:

Web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Server-side programming with Java.

Database connectivity and management using MySQL.

Implementation of real-world CRUD functionality.

🌐 Purpose
The system not only simplifies administrative tasks but also acts as a hands-on learning project for students, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in software development.
